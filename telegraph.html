      <h1>The Telegraph</h1>
      <p>The telegraph is a device that sends coded information, most commonly morse code, across long distances created by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1873. The telegraph sent this information by using electronic wires, and it was key to the Union's victory in the war. Abraham Lincoln set up a "telegraph room" which acted as his command center. This revolutionized the way he communicated with the army, as he was able to send and receive information and commands for generals in real time.
      <h2>Morse Code</h2>
      <p>Morse code is the system developed by Samuel F.B. Morse that allows communnications through a telegraph. The code is a system of dots and dashes that represent letters. While being slower than today's forms of texting, Morse Code was the foundation for real time communication that we take for granted today.</p>
