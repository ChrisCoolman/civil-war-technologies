      <h1>Railroads</h1>
      <p>The Civil War is considered the first modern war, and trains are one of the reasons for that. Trains provided a new method of transport for moving troops and supplies across the country very fast. Trains were crucial for bringing supplies to armies, which is why William Sherman destroyed Confederate rail lines during his march.</p>
      <h2>South vs North Manufacturing</h2>
      <p>The South had an agricultural based economy Pre-Civil War which meant that when the time called for trains the Union was far ahead of them technologically. The Union was also the manufacturing capital of America, so their railroads had more modern train technology then that of the Confederacy. One example of this improved technology was the iron used to make railroads. The South was still using easily breakable soft iron while the North was experimenting with more durable iron. The South also did not have the resources to import and manufacture railroads like the North did. The South also used a different Gauge then the rest of America which meant that they couldn't get supplies by rail from the North before the Civil War.</p>
