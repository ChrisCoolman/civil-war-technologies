      <h1>Repeating Rifle</h1>
      <p>One of the major advancements of the Civil War was the repeating rifle. Unlike the muskets of the Revolutionary War, these rifles could fire many bullets automatically called Minie Balls. The one used by the Union was called the Spencer Carbine, which was patented by Christopher M. Spencer in 1860. While these weapons were closer to the ones of the modern times, military tactics in the Civil War were still similiar to those in the Revolutionary War, which resulted in massive casualties.</p>
